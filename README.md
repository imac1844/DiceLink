DiceLink Alpha release

DiceLink v0.1.0
By imac1844



DiceLink aims to take real dice and put them in FoundryVTT. Pictures and a detailed description are
forthcoming. Utilizing more strict photograph parameters than other implementations, it is able to
reliably identify dice against a set of reference photos.

To Do:
- Restructure for more OOP
- Foundry Websocket instead of python local one
	- integrate calls from foundry socket with expected rolls for better ID
= Build the JS module to translate the roll data to foundry
